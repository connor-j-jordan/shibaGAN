## shibaGAN: Predicting 3D genome folding from DNA sequence
___

This project is largely adapted from [hicGAN](https://github.com/kimmo1019/hicGAN) and [Akita](https://github.com/calico/basenji/tree/master/manuscripts/akita) under the MIT and Apache licenses, respectively.

shibaGAN substitutes the L<sub>2</sub> MSE objective function used by Akita for an adversarial approach, constructing a GAN around Akita's 'head' model.
